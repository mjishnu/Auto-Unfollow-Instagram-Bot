# InstagramAutoUnfollow
This automated script for Instagram helps you easily unfollow users from your following list. After the first login, the bot saves the session cookie, so you wonâ€™t need to log in again. The bot unfollows one user every 10 seconds, and you can adjust the time between unfollows.
